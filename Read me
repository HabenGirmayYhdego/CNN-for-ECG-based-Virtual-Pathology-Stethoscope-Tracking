This study reports the accuracy of an electrocardiogram (ECG)-based virtual pathology stethoscope tracking method for placing virtual
symptoms in correct auscultation landmarks of patients. A one dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) algorithm
is used to classify the location of the stethoscope on each of four primary chest sites. . A 91% accuracy was obtained showing
promising performance gain over our pervious method. This finding would significantly aid in extending the capabilities of
SPs by placing virtual symptoms in correct auscultation regions.
