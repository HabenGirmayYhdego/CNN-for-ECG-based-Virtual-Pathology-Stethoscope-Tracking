# ECG-based-Virtual-Pathology-Stethoscope-Tracking

This study reports the accuracy of an electrocardiogram (ECG)-based virtual pathology stethoscope tracking method for placing virtual
symptoms in correct auscultation landmarks of patients. Different neural network algorithm is used to classify the location of the stethoscope on each of four primary chest sites. A better accuracy was obtained showing promising performance gain over our pervious method. This finding would significantly aid in extending the capabilities of SPs by placing virtual symptoms in correct auscultation regions.
